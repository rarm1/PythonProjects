# TODO: This is to aid in the automation of writing the quarterly model portfolio changes.
#   There is a video by the Pythonic accountant that deals with converting multipage CSV files
#   into usable Python data. This is the first step in getting the portfolios copied across.
#   Each fund should be it's own table with aggregates of all of the model information
#   This will remove any errors and also help to identify where there are changes.
#   It just needs to be fed tech sheets and the models templates, but that hsouldn't be too bad.
#   I think for now everything can be hard coded because it shouldn't really change place too often.
#   This is probably relatively low in the priorities as it is done every quarter rather than every week but still, cool.
