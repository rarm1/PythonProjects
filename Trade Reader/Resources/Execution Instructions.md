## First Execution ##

The first step is to open the console. This can be done either by searching 'Command Prompt' or
by using 'Windows key + r' to open 'Run' and then typing 'cmd' and pressing enter.

The first time executing this program will require the following code to be entered into Console.

```shell
python
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install sys
pip install os
pip install pandas
pip install datetime
pip install openpyxl
```

## Everytime After ##

Once the dependancies are installed (the steps above) the instructions are as follows:

```shell
X:
cd X:\Fund Management\Fund Management Team Files\Richard\Trade Reader
python main_trade_reader.py
```

Then follow the instructions on screen.
